Qwik-Start
==========

Qwik Start is an [Initializr](http://www.initializr.com/) inspired mobile friendly web template based on the HTML5 Boilerplate to get you started with your web applications.

## Quick start

Clone the git repo - `git clone git@github.com:gneatgeek/Qwik-Start.git` - or [download the current tag](https://github.com/gneatgeek/Qwik-Start/zipball/v1.0)

## Features

* Built on the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
* Menu button for smaller screens keeps navigation from cluttering up your limited space.
* Mobile first responsive design
* [Sassy CSS](http://sass-lang.com/) instead of vanilla CSS
* Simple sleek design with drop-down menus in mind.

## Notes

* SASS was used to make the CSS cleaner, more readable, and more dynamic. I left an expanded compiled version of pure CSS in the CSS folder for those who don't want to mess with SASS.
** Changing the color scheme is super easy. Just edit the $baseColor variable in sass/main.scss and the scheme will dynamically update based on the color you specify.
** There are a few variables defined in the main.scss file which make changing the template quick and easy.
** The main file serves as a home for variables and mixins, it imports all the other segments as include files which are denoted as _filename.scss
